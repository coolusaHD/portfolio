The idea behind this project is to create a small portfolio website.
For me it was always a dream to have an own personal website to put on my CVs.
Therefore I decided to create a react app for it and make it puvlic to motivate other developers to create their own portfolio websites.

The first inspiration for this project was the Homepage of [craftzdog](https://github.com/craftzdog/craftzdog-homepage). So thank you @craftzdog!
